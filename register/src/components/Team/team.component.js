                                <p>A passphrase as a series of unrelated words that you can use as a password. Three words are much easier to remember than a series of random characters, letters and numbers, yet they are much harder to hack. Computer experts use passphrases whenever possible, and you should, too!</p>
                                <p>The best way to keep track of your passwords is with a password manager. I recommend 1Password. While you should never write your passphrase on a piece of paper, if someone did do that, a series random words is less obvious than a traditional password.</p>
